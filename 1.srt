- But…

322
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,333
Hey, that wasn't a real gun. It was fake.

323
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,433
Sir, it was a fake gun…

324
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:10,900
Gosh, whatever. Fine.

325
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,467
I just need to lie low for a few months, right?

326
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll just go play video games.

327
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,233
Lloyd. Lloyd.

328
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,800
Given the situation,
should I just go out with Jini Yoon for real?

329
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,833
What?

330
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,800
Lloyd, don't even joke about
doing such a thing.

331
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,800
I heard that tabloids are yapping lately

332
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,100
about how I've never had a girlfriend
and that something must be wrong with me.

333
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,633
That's because you're so cold to women

334
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,800
and you're the only member
who has never been involved in a scandal.

335
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,933
You're right, Jeong Man.

Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish,
and Margot Robbie.

337
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,567
Even when someone like that tries to hit on me,
I don't even flinch, you know?

338
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,467
- Of course, I do.
- But Jini Yoon

339
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,733
caused damage to my career.

340
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,867
Lloyd, calm down. Calm down.

341
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,133
You have to maintain your composure
in a situation like this.

342
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,633
In my opinion, Jini Yoon is a tough cookie.

343
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,033
It's suspicious how the reporters
appeared out of nowhere.

344
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,067
Forget it.

345
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,833
Even if the world ends tomorrow,

346
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,600
I'll die playing video games.

349
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,033
I almost had it.

350
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:00,200
Didn't I say I'd follow you
even to the gates of hell?

351
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,967
I worked so hard to get that gun.
How dare you destroyed it!

352
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,633
If I catch you, you're dead meat.

353

No!

354
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,567
What did I just witness?

355
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,167
Two minutes until the grand finale.

Hey! Jeong Man.

357
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,667
Back up. Back up.

358
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,067
I saw a real human weapon. I'm serious.

359
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:31,800
- Back up.
- No.

I can't do that even if
you met your dream girl!

You have to be there for the grand finale.

362
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,633
Aren't the South Korean punks
practically mentally ill?

363
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:47,967
They follow around damn singers

364
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,200
and waste their time and money.

365
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,100
If they're still bored, they make prank calls.

366
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,567
It doesn't seem like it was a mere prank call.

What do you mean?

368
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:04,767
I found this, sir.

369
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,733
Isn't this a detonator?

370
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:11,133
I thought hard about it, but Violet…

Don't make a big deal out of it!

No, sir.

00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,033
I'll look into this matter separately,

377
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,600
so keep your mouth shut, Comrade Baek.
Got that?

378
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,233
Understood, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

Did you forget my order
to disappear without a trace?

I'm sorry, sir.

You said you'd find a way at all costs
as long as I finish my training.

403
