1
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,033
Get out of my way!

2
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,300
I said, "get out of my way!"

3
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:30,667
Let me have some.

4
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,967
Cut that out.

5
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,233
This is hell, got that?

6
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:37,433
You have to step on and kill whoever it may be

7
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:41,200
in order to survive. Got that?

8
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:48,100
Come on. Take it now.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,333
Are you really Comrade Jae Hoon?

10
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,533
Yes.

11
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,533
It's been so long, Yeong Ok.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,633
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

13
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,633
Gosh, wait.

14
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,067
I think you're embracing her too hard.

15
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,233
The person over here is a patient, okay?

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,067
What if the wound opens up and bleeds again?

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,267
What? Comrade Baek, are you crying?

18
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,067
So I bleed or cry. So what?

19
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:23,300
Mind your own business, Comrade No!

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,667
My fans told me

21
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,533
that I was born with a warm heart.

22
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,233
They must've not seen the true nature
behind that iron mask of yours, Comrade No.

23
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,267
What iron mask?

24
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:37,700
You must've watched
the music video of our second album.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
I really am something. Seriously.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
But who is this?

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,967
Is he your fellow countryman from North Korea?

28
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:51,067
I'd say, we're much closer than that.

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,933
It doesn't seem like you're siblings.

30
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,167
Do you go to the same church?

31
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,767
It's none of your business, Comrade No.

32
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,700
But I'm sure I could be of great help
if I made it my business.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,033
I won't bore you
with the details about who I am…

34
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,200
Hey, Comrade Baek.

35
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,600
Comrade, you talk and look

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,300
like a South Korean now.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,567
You haven't changed much

38
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,700
from our days in the training center.

39
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,867
We lost touch
after we left the training center,

40
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:27,233
so I thought you were dead, Comrade Seong.

41
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,733
I did almost die.

42
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,933
Did I injure my head
after joining the military?

43
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,467
Why do I keep worrying about her?

44
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:40,167
W-Wait a minute.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,667
There's something going on between the two.

46
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,867
Gosh, who cares?

47
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,900
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

48
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,533
What? Were you injured badly?

49
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,700
A bit during the mission…

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,533
So I got discharged.

51
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,300
It must've been quite serious
if you had to get discharged.

52
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,867
What are they doing?

53
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,533
There are children around.
Why is he lifting up his shirt?

54
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,533
What a pervert.

55
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,000
He's so sly.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,267
[Pyeonghwa Hospital]

57
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,667
Those scars are terrible.
You must've nearly got killed.

58
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,133
Do you want to see more?
I have some on my back too.

59
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,133
No, it's okay.

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,033
I'm fine now. I just need to get
physical therapy from time to time.

61
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,733
That's why you're here at the hospital…

62
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,333
What about you?
It seems like you got hurt badly.

63
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,633
This is no big deal.

64
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:19,700
Now that the unification is near,
there are no dangerous missions to carry out.

65
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,533
What happened?

66
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,433
Because of some jerk who is like a minefield,

67
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,733
it got complicated.

68
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:34,133
"Jerk"? What do you mean?

69
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,800
I doubt you're referring to me
who saved your life.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,367
She's referring to someone whose personality
and actions are terribly mean. Don't you see?

71
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,467
I saw you carelessly taking off
your shirt earlier.

72
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:48,667
Comrade Lieutenant Baek,
can I have a word with you?

73
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,533
By the way, who is this guy?

74
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,600
Is he your subordinate, Yeong Ok?

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,200
Pretty much.

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,667
Subordinate?

77
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,467
Says who? I'm not your subordinate.

78
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't belong to your unit.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,367
Don't you see
that she and I are in a conversation?

80
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,367
What a rude lad.

81
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,267
"Don't you see"? "Rude"?

82
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:15,200
Stop talking casually to me.

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,467
Excuse me. I have good stage and table manners.

84
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,433
I even have good toilet manners.

85
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:24,333
No one has ever called me rude.

86
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,467
Well then.

87
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:31,200
Get lost, will you? Show some manners.

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,233
This is a life or death matter to me,
so I can't do that.

89
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,967
A life or death matter?

90
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,067
Involving Comrade Yeong Ok?

91
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,200
- No.
- Yes.

92
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,000
Please don't get the wrong idea.

93
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:48,267
Could you please leave us alone now
if nothing is urgent?

94
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:51,000
It is. It's totally urgent. Let's go.

95
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,700
Let go of her hand at once.

96
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
You let go first.

97
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,433
Don't you know who I am?

98
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,500
Oh, FITA.

99
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,667
You're not a spy at least.

100
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,367
But your name was…

101
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,233
Avon?

102
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,433
Mr. Lloyd?

103
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,400
My greatness just oozes out
even if I'm wearing something like this.

104
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,633
Yes, hello.

105
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,900
What can I do for you?

106
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,333
Oh, would you like my autograph?

107
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,400
Let go of me. My fan's waiting.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,700
Gosh, seriously.

109
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,833
Can I also borrow a pen…

110
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,833
Attorney Kim gave me a call.

111
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:52,467
Mr. Lloyd, I'm Seo Hee Ji of JNY.

112
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,467
This isn't what I intended.

113
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,833
You bluffer.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,467
Well then, go about your business
with your competent lawyer.

115
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,700
She and I still have more to catch up on.

116
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,533
Go now.

117
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,233
You've been asking for a lawyer all day long.

118
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,233
Shall we?

119
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:28,733
I've never seen a male comrade
as noisy and unfocused as he is.

120
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,733
If Lloyd's fans heard what you said,
they'd consider you their enemy.

121
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,133
But I can't help it.

122
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,367
The South Korean female comrades

123
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,700
are so attracted to him.

124
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,333
I really don't understand.

125
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,367
They're even willing to risk their lives.

126
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,467
I operate a small pub in Pyeonghwasi.

127
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,600
Come visit sometime.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,900
Yes, okay.

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,467
There was an order to assign you
to the Defense PR Support Unit,

130
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:13,900
but you were suddenly sent
to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

131
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,700
I don't understand.

132
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I don't understand, either.

133
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,267
This isn't an ordinary unit,
but Special Forces.

134
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,800
This isn't a place for me.

135
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,933
It's a conspiracy. It totally is.

136
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,267
A conspiracy?

137
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,967
They even threatened me earlier
about possessing an illegal weapon.

138
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,033
Threatened you?

139
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,333
It was disguised as a persuasion,
but actually was a threat.

140
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,200
As for the possession of an illegal weapon,

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,967
we can resolve the misunderstanding
if Ms. Baek Yeong Ok testifies.

142
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,333
But you said, she isn't cooperative, right?

143
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,400
We have to make her cooperate somehow.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
But unit assignment is a military matter,

145
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
so it won't be easy to resolve.

146
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,300
My life's always been this way.

147
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,400
Before or after my debut,

148
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,533
nothing's ever been easy for me.

149
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,033
But you know what?

150
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,367
I never give up.

151
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,400
It makes it interesting, you know?

152
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,900
I'll see you again
after doing some additional research.

153
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,967
I look forward to working with you, ma'am.

154
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,333
My name is Seo Hee Ji.

155
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,533
Okay, Attorney Seo Hee Ji.

156
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,567
See you later.

157
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,367
I'll take the case.

158
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,767
The client is Lloyd of FITA.

159
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:54,067
If anything goes wrong,
tens of millions of their fans will hate me.

160
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:58,633
Besides, it's a complicated case
involving even higher-ups.

161
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,267
You come out even at best.

162
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:06,667
My network, academic and family background,
and understanding of idol stars are stellar.

163
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,600
Despite all other aspects,

164
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:14,033
I'm the most qualified person for this.

165
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,600
That gun was fake, wasn't it?

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,967
You're the one who told me that.

167
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,833
So what?

168
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,533
Are you asking me to testify
that Comrade Vice Commissioner Lee is lying?

169
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,267
That's exactly it.

170
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,000
Just tell the truth. Simple, isn't it?

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
You have a South Korean lawyer on your side.

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,067
Why do you need my confirmation?

173
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,667
If a North Korean comrade testifies,

174
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:36,567
they won't be able to threaten me anymore.

175
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm a soldier. I only follow orders.

176
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't open my mouth so carelessly.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,533
But that gun was fake. You know that.

178
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,433
I'm just asking you to tell the truth.

179
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:51,967
I won't do it.
I didn't receive an order to do so.

180
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:54,000
To that man earlier,

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,600
it looked like you would give him
anything he asks for.

182
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
But why do you treat me like this?

183
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:05,667
I've known him since he saved my life
when we were little. I owe him my life.

184
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:08,500
What about me? I saved your life too!

185
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,733
Don't you dare compare yourself to him.

186
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:10,900
It's not the same.

187
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,933
Gosh.

188
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
Look at you glaring.

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,300
Look softly.

190
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Glaring?

191
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,700
You're shooting lasers out of your eyes.

192
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,333
I feel like my skin is burning.

193
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,933
Just tell the truth.

194
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,567
That's all I'm asking for.

195
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,667
You just need to say it once.

196
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,833
Gosh, that stings.

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,133
Thank you. Goodbye.

198
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,300
Welcome.

199
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:14,133
You operate that restaurant
without a single day of rest. Aren't you tired?

200
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,333
What will you do with all that money you earn?

201
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:20,333
The more money you earn,
the better it is. Isn't it?

202
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:24,133
By the way, what are you putting up?

203
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,833
A love letter. My love letter.

204
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,967
"Because I, the poor one, love Natasha,"

205
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,333
"heavy snow is falling tonight."

206
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,533
Isn't your wife in North Korea?

207
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,033
Natasha?

208
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,767
Are you in love with a woman from Russia?

209
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,633
No, that's not it.

210
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:47,267
It's a poem written by a poet
whom my wife used to love.

211
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,567
I see.

212
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,900
This verse is my favorite.

213
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,400
"I think of Natasha"

214
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,000
"and Natasha will come for sure."

215
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:02,100
As long as I remember her,

216
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,667
she'll come for sure.

217
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:06,333
- Don't you think so?
- Yes, of course.

218
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,067
You'll see each other again for sure.

219
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,000
Hello.

220
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,833
Will she really show up here
knowing that she might die?

221
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,767
I was skeptical, but she assured me.

222
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,633
If you won't stop hunting me down,

223
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:01,067
I'll disappear with the file forever.

224
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,000
You know that it's not possible
to disappear forever.

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,533
We aren't the only ones who are after you.

226
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,367
Then what do you want from me?

227
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:10,133
You betrayed the organization
to save that singer.

228
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,933
You'd better return if you want to save him.

229
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:17,467
If you do anything to Lloyd,
I'll not let you slide.

230
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,300
Jae Hoon.

231
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:43,200
Park Il Doo, the North Korean authority figure
of the Unified Security Agency of Pyeonghwasi.

232
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,133
He rose to the top while I was gone.

233
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,467
It's going to hurt quite a bit when he falls.

234
00:14:56,033 --> 00:15:00,567
Yo. Do you want to eat out
over the weekend, Do Hyeon?

235
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,233
Is there somewhere nice to go in Pyeonghwasi?

236
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,133
I've done research

237
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,600
on all the places with good reviews.

238
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,667
Let's go check them out, man.

239
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,133
Wow.

240
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,333
What a nice life you have.

241
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,467
You have money to burn, don't you?

242
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:21,567
Sure, John. Let's go out.

243
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go to a top-rated restaurant,
which isn't available in North Korea,

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
and stuff ourselves.

245
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,933
- Comrade Cheol Gyu.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,267
Let's go out too.

247
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,267
Yes, sir.

248
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,033
Hello.

249
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,367
You must be the grandmother of Mi Rae,
the new student.

250
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,700
- Mom.
- Jun Seo. Did you have a good day?

251
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,133
I'm not her grandmother,

252
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:50,900
but please help me look after Mi Rae.
Thank you.

253
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,600
You must be from North Korea.

254
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,300
I suppose Mi Rae's mom works?

255
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,167
Grandmother, you always pick her up.

256
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,600
Do you think what I'm saying
is not worth listening to?

257
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,267
I said, I'm not her grandmother!

258
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:07,367
Let's go get, "buy one, get one free."

259
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,900
Did I say something offensive?

260
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,267
I've been cleaning up your gifts
for four days and three nights straight.

261
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,233
Lloyd, this is a fraction of all the gifts.
There are more at your place.

262
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,400
What should we do with all these?

263
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,333
Listen, Jeong Man.

264
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,533
There must be a daycare center
run by the city of Pyeonghwasi.

265
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,767
That plus the children's wards in his hospital.

266
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:31,300
We should send them to those two.

267
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
Okay.

268
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,933
And can you hand me
one of our character plush dolls?

269
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:39,367
Character plush doll? Character plush doll?

270
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Here you go, Lloyd.

271
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,000
Gosh, it's so cute. It's so lovely.

272
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,833
There we go.

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,033
Are you giving it to her as a gift?

274
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:56,167
But there are nicer
and more expensive ones here.

275
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,633
But those are from the fans.

276
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,167
You're right.

277
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,333
Gosh.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,233
Comrade Lieutenant Baek
only cares about combatting,

279
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,900
but who knows? If she sees something
as cute and lovely as that,

280
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
she might act like a human being, you know?

281
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,967
That's true.

282
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,000
Look who's talking.
You live with so many dolls.

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,567
How come you still don't
act like a human being?

284
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,400
Grow up.

285
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,433
Did you see that?

286
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,200
Even after seeing something so cute…

287
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,433
Gosh, in any case,

288
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,267
that woman has no emotions whatsoever.

289
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,867
What was that?

290
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,333
Why did I have such a weird dream?

291
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,367
That's right.

292
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,233
I was heavily traumatized, indeed.

293
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:02,267
It's totally understandable
that I'm suffering from PTSD.

294
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,233
But it wasn't even about
getting shot or stabbed.

295
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,100
With that woman out of all people.

296
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,367
She pretends to be so tough,
but she always has nightmares.

297
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,600
How dare she threw away my thoughtful gift?

298
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,600
This is useful, I'm telling you.

299
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
Worry dolls exist for a reason.

300
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,967
What in the world are you doing over here?

301
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:47,833
There you go again.

302
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:52,167
You're the one who held onto my hand tightly
and didn't let me go.

303
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,633
I didn't hold your hand.

304
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,733
Why did you come to my side to begin with?

305
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,433
Why do you have such wild dreams?

306
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:02,733
I couldn't sleep at all
because you were being so loud.

307
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:05,933
Stop bluffing!

308
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,167
I'm not bluffing.

309
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,667
Look. We were holding hands like this, right?

310
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:13,900
Look and see if I'm the one who held your hand
or if it's the other way around.

311
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,967
You didn't let go of it all night. I couldn't
pull it out because you're so strong.

312
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:24,467
Gosh, my arm is cramping up so much.

313
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,000
Here.

314
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,067
Hold onto this tightly
next time you have a nightmare.

315
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,767
I can't be there
to hold your hand every time, you know?

316
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:36,700
No thanks.

317
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,912
"No thanks." You always say that.

318
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:48,400
Is it that hard to just say, "thank you"?

[1,000 won-bill]

320
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,633
Her expression is so angelic.

321
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:17,633
When she talks to me,
she acts like an emotionless, human weapon.

322
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:19,733
Who is she talking to that she looks so…

323
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,500
What?

324
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,867
I pressed the orange drink.
Why did the cider come out?

325
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,967
Darn it! Seriously.

326
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,833
What a disaster. This machine is a total wreck.

327
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,000
I wasted my money.

328
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,367
Gosh, seriously.

329
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,000
Did Ms. Baek Yeong Ok go somewhere?

330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,567
She's on the phone outside
speaking sweetly with her boyfriend.

331
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,700
But I repeatedly cautioned her
not to move around.

332
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,733
Nurse!

333
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,300
Is her injury quite serious?

334
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,267
It could've been.

335
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,967
I don't know why she wouldn't listen to me,
the doctor.

336
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:22,000
Seriously, what's the point of providing
good treatment to North Koreans?

337
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What does it have anything to do with
being North Korean?

338
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,133
Sorry?

339
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:28,967
It's just that woman who doesn't take care
of her own body and refuses to listen.

340
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,000
To a doctor, a person should be
either a patient or a potential patient, right?

341
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Why does it matter
if the person is South or North Korean?

342
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,233
Is that the mindset you have
working as a doctor?

343
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,167
Gosh, the thing is… What I meant was that…

344
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,300
Since I'm North Korean,

345
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,533
I really don't listen. I'm so sorry about that.

346
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,667
Well, the thing is…

347
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:44,833
Doctor.

348
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,033
Please tighten my bandage wrap.

00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:06,867
Are you okay?

355
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,867
So before the peace treaty,
I went to Pyongyang.

356
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,300
But the food was amazing.

357
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,200
The North Korean dishes were so delicious.

358
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,900
They were so good.

359
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,800
I'm sure they weren't all that.

360
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,467
No. Have you had
Pyongyang-style blood sausage before?

361
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,167
It was so good that I almost died.

362
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't make a fuss.

363
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,200
May I… take your order?

364
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,567
Two orders of Gwang Tae set menu
and one sparking water.

365
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,967
And what would you like to drink?

366
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,833
I'm sorry,

367
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,600
but could you please repeat that?

368
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,167
Just two orders of Gwang Tae set menu, please.

369
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,567
Gwang Tae?

370
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:48,667
Yes.

371
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,800
Two of that, please.

372
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,100
Okay.

373
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,500
Thank you.

374
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,267
Are you sure this is a famous restaurant?

375
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,733
Yes.

376
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:06,700
It's like the three-Michelin-star restaurant.
Enough?

377
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,000
It doesn't look like it.

378
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:19,033
When it comes to food,
North Korean food tastes the best.

379
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,367
Don't you think so?

380
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,500
Enjoy.

381
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,200
It reflects our hometown's kindness.

382
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,667
But you didn't receive
the same amount of kindness.

383
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,700
What the… What's going on? Bro, that is…

384
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,933
That is not fair, bro. That is not…
Where is my meat?

385
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,467
It's a good restaurant, indeed.

386
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:44,633
They understand the customers very well.

387
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,400
This is delicious.

388
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,600
You're going out dressed like that?

389
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,333
If you go out like that
without taking care of your stab wound,

390
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:38,500
it could even lead to acute kidney injury.

391
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,300
I told you, I'm fine.

392
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm going to report everything to your superior

393
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,767
that a soldier of the Republic is going out
without receiving permission.

394
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,100
Comrade No, don't you cause trouble yourself

395
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,667
and stay in the hospital room.

396
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,933
I've never seen you wear plain clothes.
You look pretty.

397
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,600
Where is she going?

398
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,700
Hey, Jeong Man. Take off your clothes.

399
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,733
Quickly.

400
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,233
- Take off your pants.
- Wait.

401
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,367
Hey.

402
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:17,000
I heard you're from North Korea.

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,300
Do you know the Daehongdan potato song?

404
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,167
I do. I watched it on YouTube.

405
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:25,167
♪ Potato, potato, the giant potato ♪

406
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:29,600
♪ I really, really love it ♪

407
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,900
Did you really only eat potatoes
while in North Korea?

408
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
No.

409
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,933
How come only your grandmother picks you up?
You don't have a mom?

410
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,300
No, it's not like that!

411
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,267
Friends shouldn't fight, okay?

412
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,000
Mi Rae's been waiting for so long.

413
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,267
She's going to be so happy.

414
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:08,833
I just stopped by to see her face
before I return to the unit.

415
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:15,067
The school bus is arriving just in time.
What a perfect timing.

416
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,000
Mother.

417
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,033
"Mother"?

418
00:29:41,367 --> 00:29:43,367
Why did you call me "Mother" out of nowhere?

419
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,300
I didn't call you that.

420
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,733
I called you my elder sister.

421
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:50,000
Did you? I must have heard it wrong.

422
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,467
You said you'd be back after three nights.
What took you so long?

423
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:54,867
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:58,433
But still, you can't fake illness, okay?

425
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:01,567
You're going to stay the night, right?

426
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,367
Hang on just a little longer.

427
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:09,667
Then, we'll be able to live together.

428
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,667
I promise I'll find a cure

429
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:16,267
for your heart, Mi Rae.

430
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,867
Comrade No, what are you doing here?

431
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:07,933
Were you following me?

432
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,233
Me? No.

433
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:13,500
I took sick leave and stepped out.

434
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,400
It seems like you're all better
to return to the unit now.

435
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,967
Says who?

436
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:22,067
Unless you bring me a letter with orders
to return me to the PR Support Unit,

437
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm not going anywhere.

438
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,900
Then I have no choice, Comrade No.

439
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,100
Hey, over there! I'm getting kidnapped!

440
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,933
Gosh, can you handle the consequences

441
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,533
of doing this to me?

442
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,767
I'm just following orders to return with you,
Comrade Lloyd.

443
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,133
Stop telling me about following orders.

444
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,167
Let's go by the law.

445
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,233
Call my lawyer. I'm not going!

446
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,167
Obey the order as a soldier
of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

447
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,333
I said I belong to the Defense PR Support Unit!

448
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,267
It's not because I'm not strong enough.

449
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:04,933
Your stab wound.

450
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,733
Even a slightest touch
would make it painful for you.

451
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,900
That's why I'm holding back.

452
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,500
Song I.

453
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,967
♫ Believe that you will return ♫

454
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,533
♫ Whatever it is, I believe in you ♫

455
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,867
♫ I can't find you anymore ♫

456
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,500
♫ I believe in our hearts in those days ♫

457
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,467
♫ Even though it may be foolish
to turn around ♫

458
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,100
♫ Back to that time on my way ♫

459
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,633
♫How are you doing? Goodbye ♫

460
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,600
♫ Who will understand my feelings?
Oh, my heart ♫

461
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,400
♫ Only you can know. No, my heart ♫

462
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,933
♫ I can't be with you no more ♫

463
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,567
♫ A little more, a little more ♫

464
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,700
♫ I'm getting closer to you ♫

465
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,333
♫ Don't look back and don't hesitate ♫

466
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,233
♫ This day won't come again ♫

467
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:42,367
♫ Tonight ♫

468
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,433
♫ Don't turn away ♫
