1
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:15,200
I have a question, sir.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,200
Do the unit arrangements
usually take place in the middle…

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,667
of the night?

4
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,800
Landmine?

5
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,467
Stay alert. We're in the midst of war.

6
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,200
War? What are you talking about?

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,333
Comrade, you'd be the first one to die
with your state of mind.

8
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,733
Die? Why would I die?

9
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:04,517
You die!

10
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,767
This isn't a training. We use live ammunition.

11
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,067
Live ammunition?

12
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,200
Wake up, Lloyd. Come on. Let's go. Come on.

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Okay.

14
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,367
Five minutes estimated to defeat the enemy
and recapture the high grounds.

15
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,600
Do not kill the civilians.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,267
Two each at the nine
and eleven o'clock directions.

17
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,300
Three at the two o'clock direction.

18
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,267
Two of you, cover the left side.

19
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,700
Two of you, after covering fire,
gather at the central high grounds.

20
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,833
Comrade No. Stay right behind me.

21
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:05,967
I'm supposed to go to the PR Support Unit
after being discharged today. Not this.

22
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:07,667
Lloyd.

23
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,400
You must survive.

24
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,467
Get moving now!

25
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,100
Hey, who are we fighting against?

26
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,900
Hey. Hey.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,367
Hurry up.

28
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,467
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,633
Private No Gwang Yeon.

30
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,333
A gun isn't a toy.

31
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,233
Fire first if you don't want to die. Got it?

32
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,000
Got it.

33
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,733
Darn it. Comrade Gang Do Hyeon.

34
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:38,867
Comrade!

35
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,600
Get down!

36
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,633
Lloyd! Lloyd!

37
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,033
Lloyd! Lloyd!

38
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,600
[FITA]

39
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,967
[FITA]

40
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:01,700
Don't cry! Don't cry!

41
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,567
Don't cry! Don't cry!

42
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't cry! Don't cry!

43
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,100
Don't cry! Don't cry!

44
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
You can't join the military.

45
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,833
You're the breadwinner of our family.
Who will bring in money?

46
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,500
I've earned enough for us to live on.

47
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:24,367
Son. More income requires more expenses.

48
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,700
We have to pay more taxes
now that we have a bigger house.

49
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,067
Your showy father spends money like water
to keep up his status.

50
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,900
What about
your younger sibling's tuition abroad?

51
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,233
But everyone has to go at some point.
It's better to get it over with.

52
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,133
What is Mr. Ban doing?
He can't even take care of your military issue.

53
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,767
My fans don't want me to skip the military.

54
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,367
Neither do I.

55
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:47,533
I'm concerned that you might get hurt.
What if you die due to an accident?

56
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:53,500
I'd better go get
a few good life insurance policies.

57
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,667
You never know.

58
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:08,600
Mr. Ban, I'll join the military.

59
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,933
Get up now.

60
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,633
Stop making a fuss over a blank and get up now.

61
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,333
Wasn't it live ammunition?

62
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
But it hurts.

63
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,033
Mountain Hawks Team One
of the Unified Armed Force Unit reporting.

64
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,367
Sunflower. Currently at 1715,
the enemy has been completely eliminated.

65
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:13,100
One of our men was killed.
We'll finish up the counterterrorism training.

66
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,000
What do you mean by training?

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
That was the counterterrorism training.

68
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,967
You told me a war broke out earlier.
What? It was the counterterrorism training?

69
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,367
This is the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit
of Pyeonghwasi.

70
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,100
I suppose you lost your mind
after getting a shot by a blank.

71
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,633
Pardon? The Unified Korean Armed Force Unit?

72
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:34,800
I'm supposed to be assigned
to the Defense PR Support Unit today.

73
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,933
Oh, my god, Lloyd.

74
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,967
Never? You had no idea?

75
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Clean up quickly
and return to the living quarters.

76
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,533
Excuse me!

77
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,533
You and I have unfinished business, don't we?

78
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,767
What unfinished business?

79
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,733
Don't you remember me?

80
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,400
- You smashed my gun!
- Don't disrespect the Comrade Major General.

81
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
Comrade Major General?
We aren't North Korean soldiers.

82
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,267
This is the Unified Korean Armed Force Unit.

83
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:14,133
Exactly my point. I shouldn't be here.

84
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm John Kim. Nice to meet you.

85
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,200
Because the team members didn't work in unity,

86
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,167
Comrade Lloyd of us Mountain Hawks
was shot to death today.

87
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,633
Mountain Hawks, you lost a member.
You'll march back instead of driving.

88
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,067
Put on the full combat gear and gather up.

89
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,000
But I marched yesterday. I have to do it again?

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,067
I can't even walk properly
because of the blisters on my toes.

91
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,167
Move it!

92
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,267
Seriously, what is this place?

93
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:52,067
The unit was formed to combat terrorism,
but it has become the symbol of Pyeonghwasi.

94
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,200
Rather than working only behind closed doors,
I wanted to bring it to light

95
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,733
to showcase the unity of two Koreas.

96
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:02,200
Now we'll have Lloyd too. How amazing.

97
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,733
Given Lloyd's popularity, it's really amazing.

98
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,733
I got very lucky.

99
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,467
What do you mean, lucky?

100
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,167
You contributed significantly.
You're really something.

101
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,933
When we put on a military uniform,
we all become soldiers

102
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,767
and when we join the military,
we all become sons of the country.

103
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,767
What's all the fuss about?

104
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:22,767
You're so oblivious
when it comes to marketing. Gosh.

105
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:28,000
Mayor Won, Pyeonghwasi, our city,
will be recognized globally.

106
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,800
Then I should've ordered them to take
a promotional photo at the training today.

107
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,333
My bad.

108
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,467
What did you say?

109
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,867
Are you saying he participated
in today's training?

110
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:40,733
I was just informed
that he was shot to death during the training.

111
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,300
What? Shot to death?

112
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,733
Do you know what I had to do
to bring Lloyd to Pyeonghwasi?

113
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:48,267
But he just completed the new recruit training.

114
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,733
How could you put him through
such tough counterterrorism training?

115
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,800
Don't you like equality in South Korea?

116
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
He wouldn't want to be the talk of the town
for receiving preferential treatment.

117
00:10:58,433 --> 00:10:59,767
I'm warning you.

118
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,733
If Lloyd sustained
even a small scratch on his face,

119
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll hold you responsible. Got that?

120
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,233
Lloyd. Here it is.

121
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,500
Ms. Baek of Mountain Hawks Team One
of the Unified Armed Force Unit.

122
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,800
We don't belong to South or North.
Please decide how we should call each other.

123
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,300
Do you still not realize why you lost
a teammate during today's training?

124
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,333
Comrades, did you get into a fight?

125
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
Why do you keep calling us "comrades"…

126
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,933
Comrade Gye, did you trip Comrade Gang
when we were infiltrating just now?

127
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,033
No, ma'am.

128
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,100
Do you not know that you get punished at once
if you hurt a teammate during an operation?

129
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,267
It's my fault.

130
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,567
I got in Comrade Gye Nam Sik's way
trying to go faster than him.

131
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,167
Comrade Gye Nam Sik.

132
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,633
Since Comrade Gang Do Hyeon says so,
I'll let it slide today.

133
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,567
Work together as a team
and set a unifying title to call each other.

134
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,433
Move it now.

135
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,933
That fool

136
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,067
is going to lure that girl
who is crazy about some cheap singer

137
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,733
to get information on Violet.

138
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,967
Shake up the South Korean comrade before that.

139
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,233
I'll show him the power of our republic

140
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,467
and make him cooperate fully.

141
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,733
Excuse me.

142
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,500
I have leg cramps. Cramps.

143
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,067
I have cramps!

144
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,467
I have cramps!

145
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,667
I said, I have cramps, you crazy bastards.

146
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,133
I have cramps. Darn it.

147
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,133
[Interrogation Room]

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,700
What do you think?

149
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,100
Nothing particular, sir.

150
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,033
You have important things to do. You must eat.

151
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,633
I know that you gave us information
trying to save Lloyd.

152
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,833
But to the other side, you're a traitor.

153
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,600
If you help us, we'll guarantee your safety.

154
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,800
You guys are capable of threatening
a kid like me.

155
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,967
How would you be able to guarantee my safety?

156
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,567
We're not trying to threaten you.
We're asking for your cooperation.

157
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,867
Please trust us.

158
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,300
We'll protect you until the end,
Ms. Han Song I.

159
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,833
I don't trust anyone.

Then,

00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,200
would you trust Lloyd?

162
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,233
What do you mean?

163
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,700
Two boxes, right?

164
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,700
Chateau… Cheva?

165
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Chateau Cheval Blanc.

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,067
You're the owner. You should know
how to say the wine names properly.

167
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,133
You order me around to deliver boxes.

168
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,133
Are you sure I'm the owner?

169
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,700
Why do you keep ordering wine
that doesn't even sell well?

170
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Natasha.

171
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,133
She used to like it.

172
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,967
A glass of wine. A single flower.

173
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,067
Oh, I see.

174
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:10,800
How lovely.

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,700
When will you come?

176
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,867
Song I hacked our list.

177
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,033
Where have you been while a single loach
was turning the entire place into muddy mess?

178
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:39,267
Our organization works in small groups.
If our list is exposed, we'd be done for.

179
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,767
Find out where she is
and secure the list again.

180
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,933
We already know.

181
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,667
Where is she?

182
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,267
Please don't worry.

183
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:04,167
The list hasn't made it to the hands
of the national security agency.

184
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,400
Unification!

185
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,233
- Unification! Thank you for your hard work.
- Gosh.

186
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,900
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

187
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Unification.

188
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,267
Unification.

189
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,733
Has Comrade Lloyd returned?

190
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,767
Not yet.

191
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
You're teaching him a lesson.

192
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Work him harder.

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But wouldn't it cause any trouble?

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,933
I doubt it.

195
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:54,933
I have Vice Commissioner Lee under my control.

196
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,900
You just need to do as I say,
Comrade Major General Baek.

197
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,400
Yes, Comrade Vice Commissioner.

198
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,233
Bring Comrade No to me as soon as he gets back.

199
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:06,067
I want to bring him to the informant.

200
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,533
Yes, understood.

201
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,700
How can soldiers be so disloyal?

202
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,033
In the movies,

203
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,800
teammates help each other carrying the gear

204
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,600
and get punished together
if someone falls behind.

205
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,800
Where am I? I'm starving. Seriously.

206
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,433
Should we eat a boxed meal for dinner?

207
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,133
There are leftovers
from yesterday's food to be discarded.

208
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,167
What are you talking about?

209
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,800
Your body is precious carrying a baby.
You can't eat something like that.

210
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
Let's eat something nice.

211
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,333
Precious? You're making me blush.

212
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,733
If we don't save up diligently now,

213
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,500
when will we be able to buy a house
and settle down as a family?

214
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,667
- Yu Jin.
- Sang Hoon.

215
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,067
You guys are so lovey-dovey.

216
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,467
You're here.

217
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,433
Don't mind us. Keep going.

218
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,200
- My goodness, ma'am.
- No worries.

219
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,233
We haven't met. What's your name?

220
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,500
My name is Mi Rae.

221
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,700
It's my relative.
She'll be staying with me for a while.

222
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,700
Mi Rae, make sure you greet them
whenever you see them from now on.

223
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,067
Hi, Mi Rae.

224
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,967
We have a generous deal today.

225
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:08,367
Ice cream is "buy one, get one free."

226
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,267
Mi Rae, good for you.

227
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,900
Honey, you're mixing
South Korean, North Korean, and English,

228
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,467
all three languages together again.

229
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,967
That's why Pyeonghwasi is a great place.

230
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,600
We use each other's languages

231
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,000
and live harmoniously together here.

232
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,167
Yes, that's absolutely right.

233
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,867
Okay, the generous ice cream deal
of "buy one, get one free."

234
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:32,400
Let's get a variety and try them.

235
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,600
- Over here.
- Yes!

236
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,933
- What?
- Hush.

237
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,533
Gwang Yeon, how is it that you're here?

238
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,300
Gwang Yeon?

239
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,000
What? You're our fan, aren't you?

240
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,467
Yes, I am.

241
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,700
We only gave it to our fans
the year we debuted.

242
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,567
- You must be a big fan of ours.
- Yes.

243
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,333
Wait, you need to run now.

244
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,233
Who are they?

245
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:47,267
Why are you being chased?

246
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,300
You shouldn't be here, Lloyd.

247
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,000
I know. I should've been deployed
to the PR Support Unit.

248
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:56,967
I think it's my fault.

249
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,100
I reported it because I was worried about you.

250
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,867
But I never asked them
to let me see you. I'm serious.

251
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:04,967
What are you talking about?

252
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,333
Hey, are you okay?

253
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,767
Hey, run now!

254
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,767
Follow me.

255
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
Run! Hurry!

256
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,333
- Find her now!
- Yes, sir.

257
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,833
Hey, you're bleeding. Are you okay?

258
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,100
What about you? Are you okay?

259
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,233
I can't believe this is happening.
This isn't a dream.

260
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:56,433
I can't believe I ran into you here.
I feel like I'm in a dream.

261
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,233
Let's stop the bleeding first. Take that off.

262
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,933
- Who are those punks?
- Hush!

263
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,167
Because I have something,
they can't kill me even if they catch me.

264
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:15,767
I'll draw their attention.
You get out of here at least.

265
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,467
They wouldn't have fired
if they couldn't kill you.

266
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,933
I'm FITA.

267
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,767
I protect my fans. You know that, right?

268
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,300
Don't you know that I set the new 100m record
for the Idol Star Athletics Championships?

269
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,267
I'll go lure them.
You go and call for help quickly.

270
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,633
No.

271
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,767
You just run that way no matter what.

272
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,567
You want to see me again, right?

273
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,900
If you want to see me again,

274
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,567
don't look back and run. Got that?

275
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:01,900
See you again.

276
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:05,800
Lloyd.

277
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,733
Get her!

278
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,767
If you keep doing that,
your eyes are going to pop out.

279
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,500
Even if you wait like this,
she can't visit you every day, you know?

280
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,033
I was just looking. I'm not waiting.

281
00:24:40,467 --> 00:24:41,900
Wash up and go to bed.

282
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,533
After some days go by,

283
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:48,100
she'll come someday. Okay?

284
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,233
Gosh, I almost died.

285
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:11,667
Where am I?

286
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,000
There's nowhere to go. What do I do?

287
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,333
Song I, enough already.

288
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,133
Hello.

289
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,233
Who are you?

290
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:36,567
You're making me sad. Please don't do that.

291
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,600
What scares me the most is being forgotten
while I'm in the military.

292
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
You aren't joking, right?

293
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,267
Put your hands up.

294
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,000
Put your hands up, you bastards!
What's with you guys?

295
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,467
Put your hands up, you bastards!
I said, hands up.

296
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,767
No unit receives live ammunition
while in training.

297
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,900
Oh, is that right? I wasn't aware of that.

298
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,767
I surrender.

299
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,100
I surrender. Don't shoot.

300
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,433
I surrender.

301
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,867
Do you need money? I have plenty.

302
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:06,567
I have a lot, but I don't have my phone,
so I can't transfer it.

303
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,433
To which bank? Please don't shoot!

304
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,233
What happened?

305
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,800
How is it that you're here?

306
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,167
I don't leave a fallen soldier behind.

307
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,900
You're really amazing.

308
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,133
Comrade, you must be from 112.

309
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,200
Farewell.

310
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,133
No, this isn't going to work!

311
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,767
♫ I'm clumsy and awkward ♫

312
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:29,500
♫ But I try to act like it's nothing ♫

313
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,100
♫ As a day goes by ♫

314
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,067
♫ And another month goes by ♫

315
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,200
♫ Will I be ♫

316
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,733
♫ A little closer to you then ♫

317
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:43,067
♫ You and me ♫

318
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,400
♫ So special ♫

319
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,300
♫ Love my hurt ♫

320
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,033
♫ Only for you ♫

321
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,300
