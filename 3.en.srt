💞kissasian.one 💞

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:48.467
Number 127.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.300
Do you still think you're Baek Yeong Ok,
the daughter of Director Baek Ri Soo?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.833
You leeched on people's blood
and lived the high life in Pyongyang

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:55.967
eating well.

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:58.667
Run faster.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.600
Get out of my way!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.500
I said, "get out of my way!"

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.500
Let me have some.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:38.033
Let me have some.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.367
Cut that out.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:44.633
This is hell, got that?

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.900
You have to step on and kill whoever it may be

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.067
- in order to survive. Got that?
- Take it now.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.167
Come on. Take it now.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.167
Did you really see Baek Yeong Ok?

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.467
Yes, sir.
I'm certain that it was Comrade Baek Yeong Ok.

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.420
You're saying, you got rid of her?

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.467
Yes, sir.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.100
Seung Tae.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:35.367
You can't just assume that you got rid of her.
It must be verifiable.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.167
And you know that she's no match for you guys.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.433
If you went out to catch a rabbit,
stick to the plan.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:49.400
Why can't you realize that you could be killed
if you go after a tiger instead?

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.867
Stick with the rabbit. Got that?

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.633
Yes, sir.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.800
Don't sacrifice your life
for a drill that's good for nothing.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:03.767
We're not soldiers.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.400
Where am I?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm alive.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.700
Be quiet.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.233
We're not safe yet.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.533
By any chance, on your way over,

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:47.933
did you see a girl?

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:51.267
I sent her away safely in a car
that was driving by.

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:53.300
That's why I was delayed.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.333
You're amazing, indeed.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.667
You're quite something yourself too, Comrade.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.667
Pardon?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.967
Putting one's own life on the line
for someone else

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.467
isn't an easy thing to do.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:13.367
Is that what she said?

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:15.400
That I put my life on the line?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.167
I wasn't thinking that at all at that moment.

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:21.500
If I really had to risk my life,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.700
I don't think I could've done it.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:27.633
I agree.

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:34.400
How is it possible that you can't contact
First Lieutenant Baek by radio?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.367
She'd guard the walkie-talkie over her own arm.

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.533
She was trained at Wonsan 112.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:41.700
Comrade Lieutenant Baek
was trained at Wonsan 112?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.267
If you don't want to be
discharged dishonorably, find her at once.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:50.967
Yes, sir.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.120
[Personal Information]

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.688
[Name
Date of birth]

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:06.267
United force? Unification? You were all talk.

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:08.667
I knew you were scheming something
behind my back,

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.367
but I didn't think you'd do that
in a dire situation like this.

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:12.733
Please calm down.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.367
I was going to share it after I confirm it.

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:18.633
Share it? The Coordination Committee
changed everything already.

00:05:18.633 --> 00:05:20.767
That's manipulation, not sharing.

00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:23.867
A Violet member was among us.

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.100
She took Han Song I.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.067
We, the Security Agency,
became a laughingstock.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:34.233
So you intend to keep the incident a secret
by deleting the CCTV footages?

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.367
Can you be sure
that there's only one Violet among us?

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.767
It was a security issue

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:43.233
and I didn't intend at all
to handle it on my own.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:47.467
Here. Look.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.200
You know something. Don't you?

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.400
Don't blame it on North Korea
whenever there's an issue!

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.900
Fine, just say you don't.
Why are you getting mad?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200
You spat on me.

00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:13.544
It's freezing.

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:19.167
It's freezing.
How long do we have to stay here like this?

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.500
Don't you have a walkie-talkie or a cell phone?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.000
We'll wait at least an hour before going back.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.900
I saw you wearing a walkie-talkie
on your back earlier…

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.233
Are you hurt?

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:31.700
- I'm fine.
- But it looks like you're bleeding.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.900
Are you okay?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.367
Wake up.

00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:39.400
Gosh. Wait.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.533
I was in a variety show
getting the First Aid Certification.

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:49.233
Please don't get me wrong.
I'm trying to treat your wound.

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.900
If you press down hard like this,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.367
I heard that you can stop the bleeding.

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:04.167
Lean on me like this.

00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:08.233
Satisfied?

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:11.100
You punks are the best of the best
in both the North and South Korea combined.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.767
But you were punished like simple soldiers.

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:13.900
No, sir.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.900
You basically lost your heads and limbs today.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.167
Got that?

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:22.167
Get up.

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.100
Do whatever it takes

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.833
to find her at once. Got that?

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:31.200
Yes, sir!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.267
Let's go.

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:36.267
- Attention. Unification!
- Unification!

00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.300
At rest.

00:07:40.867 --> 00:07:42.533
Exactly the top of the hour.

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:43.733
Starting now until midnight--

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:46.333
Midnight, my foot.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.400
Twenty-four hours.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.700
No, even if we spend many days and nights,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.433
if we can't find Comrade Lieutenant Baek,
we'll all be sent to a coal mine!

00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:56.500
You don't use your brain.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.000
That's why you fail even easy tasks.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.433
What did you say?

00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:01.167
I didn't say anything wrong.

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.867
This is all because of
that foolish South Korean comrade.

00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:05.400
Don't you see?

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.200
No, no. Stop, stop.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.867
We shouldn't blame each other. Come on.

00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:12.900
We're like this because our teamwork is broken.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.500
Hey, they don't know what "teamwork" means.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.933
They only know to "charge forward."

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:20.267
You stinky breath. When I charge forward,

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:21.800
don't you bog me down.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.133
Speak for yourself.

00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:24.767
All right, let's go.

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:27.000
Let's go. Move, move.

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:41.133
Byoung Man said this is how you start a fire.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.300
How come it's not working?

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.033
It seemed to work well in the jungle.

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.867
The moment you faint, you die.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:18.100
Wake up!

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:25.733
Your father was
a high-ranking officer of the Republic

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:28.400
and your mother was
a professor at Kim Il Sung University.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.100
Thanks to your proud parents
who were both powerful,

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.900
I'm sure you thought
your life would only be rosy.

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:44.167
Why are you doing this?

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:51.333
Honey!

00:09:57.533 --> 00:09:59.833
- Honey!
- Honey.

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:01.433
Father.

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:04.033
Please don't go.

00:10:04.033 --> 00:10:06.233
Yeong Ok!

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.700
But you erased the shame
of being the opposition

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.900
and endured the hellish 112 training center
for South Korea.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.167
Mother.

00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:35.700
Mother.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.967
Father.

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:42.767
Please don't go.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.900
Become the best warrior of the Republic!

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.500
That will be the only way
you'll be able to wash away

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.533
your parents' sorrow
and to live together as a family.

00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:14.833
I should go call the emergency hotline.

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:16.833
She might die.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.300
Don't… go.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.300
Hey, look.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.733
I have to go ask for help.
Otherwise, you might die.

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:33.333
Please… Please don't go.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:38.400
What should I do? Seriously.

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:01.967
South Korean Comrade, take a break.

00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:05.000
I'll look through the southeast side again.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.867
Why would I take a break?

00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:09.800
You might get lost too.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.467
We should ask for help.

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:13.433
Let's ask the superiors… for help.

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:16.333
- No, we're going to find her.
- We have to find her ourselves.

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:23.733
Wait!

00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:25.767
Over there.

00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:30.400
Call a medic. Call a medic!

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.300
- Medic. Call a medic!
- What? What happened?

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:01.333
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:02.533
- Can you recognize me?
- Lloyd.

00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:05.333
Mr. Ban was so worried about you.

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:12.333
This isn't a dream, right?

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:16.267
I would say, the dreamlike reality?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.467
Why did you get so much?

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.500
Eat up.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.900
Are you sure this is enough?

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.967
No, I'll go back in now and cook something…

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:35.467
No, it's okay, Honey.

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:38.267
It's just that I remembered the time
when we were in Kaesong.

00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:40.333
You were enjoying the food so much.

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:43.067
Thinking about those days
is making me have cravings.

00:13:43.067 --> 00:13:44.333
Yes, right.

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:45.700
Whenever I bought something,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.333
you told me
that it was "buy one, get one free."

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.267
I thought it was strange.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.367
I gave the "buy one, get one free" deal
only to you,

00:13:52.367 --> 00:13:55.233
but you always gave me the extra one you got.

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:59.200
Is that why we're having twins too?

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:01.967
Our dear Peace and Unification.

00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:04.900
Eat well and grow big.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.200
Grow big.

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:09.467
Hello, you're here.

00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:10.567
Not many days left, right?

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:13.167
No, just a month away.

00:14:13.733 --> 00:14:16.067
May I have one of those?

00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:18.300
Yes, sure.

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:40.633
Sir, what did the owner of Uno Pub do before?

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:42.600
I heard a rumor he's the third-generation scion
of a chaebol family.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.433
Or is he a secret, illegitimate child
of a chaebol family?

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:48.567
Gosh, how would I know
the owner's personal information?

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:52.233
Here you go.

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:54.867
By the way, how come you always only eat that?

00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:59.333
Nowadays, even North Korea
makes different types of snacks.

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.800
She always

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.000
smelled so sweet just like this snack.

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:09.700
If you saw her face, would you recognize her?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.333
No matter how many years go by,

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:17.033
I wouldn't be able to forget
her beautiful face.

00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:27.333
Bye.

00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:34.344
- Hey, eat now.
- Okay. It'll get soggy.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:38.600
Why the Unified Korean Special Armed Force Unit
of Pyeonghwasi out of nowhere?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.100
No, it's the Unified Armed Force Unit.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.167
Be quiet.

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.700
That's not the point here.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.367
To keep Pyeonghwasi's peace,

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:47.600
they really need you. You have no choice.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.400
Peace, my foot!

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.567
Hey! Do you even know
what I went through there?

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:54.233
Have you been in the military?

00:15:54.233 --> 00:15:56.067
Me? Of course,

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:57.100
I haven't.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.000
- Have you done the counterterrorism training?
- No.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.533
Have you battled against lunatics

00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:04.200
who try to shoot you
and stab you from every angle?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.233
No, I haven't.

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:10.767
While I was being bombarded with bullets,

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:13.100
I defeated the resistance army!

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.367
To save a fan of mine… a fan of FITA,

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.133
I escaped a gunman!

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:19.333
All night long, I carried a woman
who was like a human weapon,

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:21.500
walked a few tens of kilometers
through the DMZ,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.600
and even saved a life. I'm that great.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.700
You know that, right?

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:31.600
I had faith in you
that you'd pull through again.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.700
What did I manage to pull through last night?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.467
I'm insane. Seriously.

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:37.533
Your fans are totally excited

00:16:37.533 --> 00:16:42.533
to hear that you've been assigned
to the Special Forces of Pyeonghwasi.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:45.767
That news has been released officially already?

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:50.367
If this doesn't go well,

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:52.367
it'd jeopardize your image
as well as that of other members.

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:55.167
And the FITA fans
will be really disappointed too.

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:57.633
No, no.

00:16:57.633 --> 00:16:58.833
What was it?

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:02.567
I saw a document that looked like an order
to transfer me to the Defense PR Support Unit.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:06.267
How could they change the plan
without informing me?

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:08.667
Hey, what happened to that plan?

00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:10.867
Well, I'm not the one who planned it.

00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:14.400
Hey. Get out.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.433
Get out.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.667
Doctor. I think I hurt my shoulder.

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:21.300
It hurts so much. Please take a look.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.500
One moment, please.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.333
Let me attend to the wounded patient first.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.967
You shouldn't be sitting up.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.133
What on earth are you doing here?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.500
You bluffer.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.033
What? Hey, Jeong Man.

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.900
What did she say? Did she just curse at me?

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.667
She called you a bluffer.

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:47.833
My goodness.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.467
Excuse me. If it weren't for me,

00:17:50.467 --> 00:17:54.267
you would've died already
from excessive bleeding. Do you even realize it?

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:58.500
Think carefully
why I even got stabbed in the first place!

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.800
Ms. Baek Yeong Ok, you have to stay
in the hospital to recover for a few more days.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.233
No, I'm fine.

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:09.800
Please check on the head of that bluffer
who is talking nonstop over there.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.467
What did you just say?

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:15.733
Mr. Lloyd, your test results are all normal

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:18.167
and you're only showing signs of exhaustion
and minor abrasion,

00:18:18.167 --> 00:18:20.567
so you can be discharged even today.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.967
Gosh, doctor.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.133
I don't think that's the case.

00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:26.133
I think I'm in a coma.

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:27.767
Gosh, MRI, please.

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:28.967
My goodness.

00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:30.933
It's all covered by the insurance,

00:18:30.933 --> 00:18:32.867
so please proceed with a CT scan too…

00:18:32.867 --> 00:18:34.900
But…

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:47.967
What a relief that Lloyd wasn't seriously hurt.

00:18:47.967 --> 00:18:49.067
Even though Pyeonghwasi is on the outskirts,

00:18:49.067 --> 00:18:52.467
firing away here is totally unacceptable, okay?

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:55.100
This isn't North Korea, you know?

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.700
If this happened in Pyongyang,

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.067
they would've been executed on the spot.

00:19:01.267 --> 00:19:05.967
The actions of Violet,
the anti-unification force, are troubling.

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:08.000
We can't let it slide this time.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.367
We have to make
an official complaint to the North.

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.433
What evidence do you have
to be so sure that it was our doing?

00:19:13.433 --> 00:19:15.467
Those Violet punks who are on the wanted list

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:17.167
are all from North Korea.

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:19.900
North Korean defectors
are from North Korea too.

00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:25.600
I'm curious about who's behind it.
The one in the shadow.

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:32.500
Well, how would I know what these cunning
and selfish South Koreans are really thinking?

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.100
Okay, okay.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.133
People who oppose our unification
can be anywhere.

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:40.400
Let's solve things one by one.

00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:48.567
- Jeong Man.
- Yes?

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:50.033
What do you call that?

00:19:50.033 --> 00:19:53.467
When the soldiers march
carrying their gears to their death.

00:19:53.467 --> 00:19:56.567
- Long distance loaded march?
- Yes, that one.

00:19:56.567 --> 00:20:00.800
I marched a long distance
carrying you on my back instead of the gear.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.300
Instead of carrying me,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.633
you should've run quickly to ask for help.

00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:05.933
I was going to do that.

00:20:05.933 --> 00:20:07.633
But you held onto my hand

00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:10.833
and begged me not to go.

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:13.733
It's not like I was shot in the head.
There's no way I would've done that.

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:14.833
Wow.

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:18.133
Listen to her. She's so shameless.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:19.533
You don't remember?

00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:23.000
Let me tell you what you did. You held my hand…

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:30.200
Don't leave me by myself.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.067
Father. Mother.

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:38.667
Please. Don't leave me by myself.

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:07.200
Cut the nonsense

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.000
and just say what you want to say, Comrade No!

00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:35.567
I'm Vice Commissioner Lee Min Ho
of the Unified Security Agency of Pyeonghwasi.

00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:37.767
It's my pleasure meeting you.

00:21:37.767 --> 00:21:40.567
Please don't say that. I almost died just now

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:44.300
thanks to you who allowed me to have
such a rare and precious experience.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.967
It's my pleasure. Nice to meet you.

00:21:48.067 --> 00:21:51.467
The Unified Armed Force Unit
doesn't operate in a traditional way.

00:21:51.467 --> 00:21:55.867
The Unified Korean Armed Force Unit respects
individual's privacy as much as possible.

00:21:55.867 --> 00:21:59.300
On top of that, within Pyeonghwasi…

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:03.200
it's not difficult to go out or stay out.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.600
You have a lot of freedom.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.300
So what now?

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.267
You can't restore my life?
Is that what you're saying?

00:22:10.267 --> 00:22:11.933
I'm not saying that I can't.

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:15.700
I'm saying that you'd be much happier here.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.833
- Jeong Man.
- Yes, Lloyd.

00:22:17.833 --> 00:22:20.933
Can you try calling Attorney Kim again?

00:22:20.933 --> 00:22:22.033
Gosh, Lloyd.

00:22:22.033 --> 00:22:23.900
Mr. Lloyd.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.667
You've become the hero of Pyeonghwasi.

00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:28.833
You put on the gauntlet, okay?

00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:30.900
"I am Iron Man." Like that?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.500
Hey, wait. Please wait.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.433
You can't do this without prior notice.

00:22:34.433 --> 00:22:35.967
We got a call.

00:22:35.967 --> 00:22:37.567
What? From who?

00:22:37.567 --> 00:22:38.867
- Hello.
- Wait, come on.

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:41.067
Take a picture. Take a picture.

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:43.167
Mr. Lloyd.

00:22:43.167 --> 00:22:45.167
How do you feel about joining
the Pyeonghwasi's Unified Armed Force Unit?

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:46.533
Do you feel okay?

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:49.567
We were informed
that you made a great impact from day one.

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:52.533
As you can see, I'm completely fine.

00:22:52.533 --> 00:22:55.467
The Unified Armed Force Unit
is Special Forces, you know?

00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:59.567
Perhaps because I've been working out regularly
as a singer,

00:22:59.567 --> 00:23:02.367
I really enjoy doing the training
with the members of my troop.

00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:04.067
I'll be earnest and diligent

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.033
as I complete my military duty. Thank you.

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:09.133
Please say a word to the FITA fans.

00:23:10.667 --> 00:23:12.400
Dear FITA fans,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.600
I'm doing well, so please don't worry.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.867
After my service,
I'll return healthy and well to perform again.

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:21.867
I love you.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.000
We'll take a picture.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.067
Picture, picture.

00:23:28.233 --> 00:23:29.467
Sir.

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:31.067
We'll take a solo shot of Lloyd.

00:23:31.067 --> 00:23:32.600
Just one shot, please.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.733
Please step aside.

00:23:38.433 --> 00:23:40.733
- Please smile nice and big.
- Sure.

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:49.067
Comrade No, you're so shameless.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.300
Please publish a nice article.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.400
Will do.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.267
[Cardiothoracic Surgery, Chief Bae Joong Jae]
Thank you.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.867
Good to see you.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.633
Yes, hello?

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:31.000
Wait!

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.133
Gosh. My goodness.

00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:36.067
People are reacting faster than I anticipated.

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:39.333
"The idol star who is most confident even among
the Unified Korean Special Forces soldiers."

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:40.567
"Lloyd,"

00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:42.367
"a role model for all idol stars."

00:24:42.367 --> 00:24:47.367
"A global idol star has been reborn
as a hero of Pyeonghwasi."

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.700
Hero, my foot.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.600
I nearly died. Thanks to you.

00:24:54.433 --> 00:24:57.933
It'll never happen again.

00:24:57.933 --> 00:24:59.100
I can guarantee that.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.900
I guarantee this too.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.167
If you don't restore my life,

00:25:03.167 --> 00:25:07.367
I'll reveal every little thing

00:25:07.367 --> 00:25:12.333
about how the Security Agency
put me in that unit without my consent!

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:16.067
Mr. Lloyd.

00:25:16.067 --> 00:25:18.700
I wasn't going to go this far and say this,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.333
but do you recall why you joined the military?

00:25:21.333 --> 00:25:23.133
Possessing an illegal weapon.

00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:25.033
That's a serious crime.

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:26.233
Wow.

00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:29.767
Some people have no conscience.

00:25:29.767 --> 00:25:32.867
Do you think you can threaten me with that?

00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:36.333
I'm sure you know that it was a fake gun.
I even have a witness.

00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:39.967
A witness? Who?

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:41.167
Hey, witness.

00:25:41.167 --> 00:25:42.900
Comrade Baek.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.567
Comrade Baek, tell him…

00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:48.167
What? Where did she go?

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:50.267
There's no one.

00:25:50.267 --> 00:25:52.867
Exactly my point. Did she go for a walk?

00:25:56.533 --> 00:26:00.500
Welcome to the Unified Armed Force Unit.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.633
Where did she go?

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.700
Gosh, you startled me.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.267
Didn't you hear me calling you?

00:26:19.267 --> 00:26:23.467
Oh, you're that person from before.

00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:24.500
You remember me, don't you?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.300
I was going to go find you.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.933
For… what?

00:26:28.933 --> 00:26:32.700
Can I buy that Golden Water right away?

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.000
We told you then too,
but it's really expensive.

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:41.667
Give me ten bottles, please.

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:43.333
Ten bottles? That many?

00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:47.700
Yes. You're sure
that it's good for the heart, right?

00:26:52.267 --> 00:26:54.933
I see. It's you who are not well.

00:26:54.933 --> 00:26:57.533
No, I'm fine.

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.633
If you drink Golden Water regularly,

00:26:59.633 --> 00:27:03.133
any illness will be healed completely.

00:27:05.033 --> 00:27:07.167
This refined gold, you see,

00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:10.567
kills bad cells
while helping good cells grow well

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:12.867
and strengthens the blood vessels.

00:27:12.867 --> 00:27:17.067
It works wonders for hearts.

00:27:17.733 --> 00:27:18.967
"Wonders?"

00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:20.700
You don't get it, do you?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.167
It expands the heart nice and full.

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:29.967
Nice and full…

00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:33.533
If you drink it every day instead of water,

00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:35.600
it'll be really good.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.400
No words can describe it entirely.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.533
So how much will do?

00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:44.133
For now, go to a nearby ATM

00:27:44.133 --> 00:27:46.867
and pay us the deposit
of one million won in cash.

00:27:46.867 --> 00:27:48.200
If you give me your address,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.433
I can deliver it to you every month
for a monthly subscription.

00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:53.467
Oh, right. You can pay in installments too.

00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:59.733
Monthly subscription? Installments?
What are they?

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.633
What else? They want to scam your money

00:28:03.633 --> 00:28:05.567
every month on a regular basis.

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:08.033
Comrade No, stay out of it.

00:28:08.033 --> 00:28:11.800
This is too terrible.
I can't stay out of it, Comrade!

00:28:12.933 --> 00:28:16.800
Young lad, you must be her boyfriend.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.333
Don't be so rude. What do you mean, scam?

00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:23.133
So, you mean, that's a cure-all?

00:28:23.733 --> 00:28:25.267
You haven't heard of Golden Water?

00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:26.800
It got the FDA approval this year…

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.633
Never.

00:28:28.633 --> 00:28:31.400
Is it good for constipation too?

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.267
It really works wonders.

00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:35.167
It'll make your butt sob.

00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:38.733
Wow, would it really?

00:28:38.733 --> 00:28:41.867
You won't be able to handle
the consequences if you're lying.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.500
What do you mean, I'm lying?

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.233
Perhaps, you don't really know
since you're from North Korea.

00:28:48.233 --> 00:28:50.000
This is South Korea.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.500
The healthcare and medical technologies
are gathered right here…

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.733
Then I'll try it.

00:28:53.733 --> 00:28:55.600
What's wrong with you? This is quite pricy.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.933
I'll pay you
ten times the asking price if it works.

00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.533
Besides, I'm South Korean.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.900
Oh, no.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.067
Llo… Lloyd?

00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:14.200
Okay, let's say I drink it and it's effective,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.300
and then my fans will really thank you.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.200
Because they know
that I've been suffering from constipation.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.800
But if I get sick or something goes wrong
after I drink it,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.033
then all your personal information
will be doxed

00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:27.200
and you'll be investigated by the police.
You can just guess what will happen next.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200
Thank you for this.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.200
No, Lloyd!

00:29:31.133 --> 00:29:33.533
Did you just call me that?

00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:37.267
I'm in your fan club.

00:29:40.633 --> 00:29:43.200
♪ Keep your eyes on me every day, I want you ♪

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.267
Gosh, seriously. Hey, come here.

00:29:46.267 --> 00:29:48.267
Wait.

00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:50.733
- Wait!
- Sorry for loving you.

00:29:50.733 --> 00:29:51.900
- Lloyd!
- What's wrong with you?

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.033
Hey. Please stop loving me.

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:55.867
No fan of mine is a fraud.

00:29:55.867 --> 00:29:58.267
Stop being my fan immediately.

00:29:58.267 --> 00:30:00.333
You jerk.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:03.000
Let go of my hand now.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.433
Don't you get what just happened here?

00:30:06.433 --> 00:30:09.000
I saved you from almost being conned.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.833
How can I trust someone who bluffs?

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.100
If you could treat illness
by drinking random liquid like this,

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.100
no one would be sick in this world.

00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:28.267
But what if they were telling the truth?

00:30:28.967 --> 00:30:31.433
What if it really could…

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.367
Are you naive or just slow?

00:30:41.367 --> 00:30:43.333
Are you usually all over the place?

00:30:43.333 --> 00:30:45.100
Cut it out.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.667
Or perhaps you're really ill?

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.567
Don't worry about me.

00:30:50.567 --> 00:30:51.900
It's none of your business.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.967
You keep making me…

00:30:55.267 --> 00:30:57.933
worry about you.

00:31:05.967 --> 00:31:08.167
Mind your own business.

00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:25.200
Comrade Seong…

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.967
Jae Hoon?

00:31:27.967 --> 00:31:29.900
How have you been?

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.167
Nice to see you,

00:31:31.167 --> 00:31:33.233
